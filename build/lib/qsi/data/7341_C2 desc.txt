7341_C2.txt - The data set in CSV (comma separated value) format.

* Data Source: Stage 4 (4-C7 years) formula milk powder
* Procedures: Take a proper amount of milk powder into a separate small hole in the 96-well plate. Then, the sample is directly irradiated by a laser Raman spectrometer. The laser power is 250mW, 350mW, 450mW, the integration time is 50s, the spectrum range is 250~2 339cm-1, and the spectral resolution is 1cm-1.

The first column is 'label'. Value is either 1 (1st Brand) or 2 (2nd Brand). The rest 2090 columns are the Raman wavenumbers. Each row is a sample. This data set is typically used for brand classification.
