This dataset contains Raman spectra of yogurt fermentation process.

yogurt_tsa_A.CSV: use GM brand fresh cow milk
yogurt_tsa_B.CSV: use MN brand fresh goat milk

Tested each 3 hours. 每3h测一次  
Record 0-12h fermentation process. 记录发酵过程
15h~24h is refrigeration after fermentation. 15h~24h 是发酵后冷藏过程

Class labels：0-8 for 0h, 3h, 6h, ... 24h 

Each class has 60 samples. 
Instrument: Thermo Fisher DXR2 Raman spectrometer

Usage: 
[1] Either of yogurt_tsa_A or yogurt_tsa_B can be used alone for tsa (time series analysis).
[2] You can also combine yogurt_tsa_A and yogurt_tsa_B to form a multi-label/multi-task dataset. 
T1 for time and T2 for brand.
