Column Meanings: Raman shift / wavenumber (cm-1). Range: 250~2339
Each row is one sample.

* Data Source: Stage 4 (4-7 years) formula milk powder
* Provider: Beingmate Baby & Child Food Co., Ltd
* Procedures: Take a proper amount of milk powder into a separate small hole in the 96-well plate. Then, the sample is directly irradiated by a laser Raman spectrometer.
